# Full-Stack To-Do List Application

This is a full-stack To-Do List application developed as part of a project using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend. The app allows users to manage tasks, including adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. The app demonstrates front-end and back-end skills with API integration, CRUD operations, and persistent data storage.

## Features

- **View Tasks**: Displays a list of tasks.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can modify task descriptions.
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be removed from the list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as complete or incomplete.

### Backend (Node.js)
- **CRUD Operations**: API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
- **Database Integration**: Supports data persistence using a database (e.g., MongoDB).
- **Validation**: Validates user input for all API requests.
- **Security**: Basic error handling and input sanitization.
